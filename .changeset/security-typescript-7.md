"@nxgt/security": minor

Accepts TypeScript 7 as well as 6: the `typescript` peer is now `^6.0.3 || ^7.0.0`, the same range in every `@nxgt/*` package, so the set installs with either and no peer conflict. The package does not use TypeScript at runtime; its built JavaScript and declarations are checked under both. Nothing changes under TypeScript 6.
